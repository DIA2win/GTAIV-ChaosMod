# GTAIV-ChaosMod
A chaos mod for Grand Theft Auto IV based on [IV-SDK](https://github.com/Zolika1351/iv-sdk) by [Zolika1351](https://github.com/Zolika1351)

**Status**: Closed beta. **Planned open beta**: Fallâ€“Winter 2025.
**Compatibility**: 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0 (tested on GTA IV 1.0.8.0 and GTA VC NE 1.0.7.0).

# Description
This mod adds random effects (temporary or instant) to your game after a certain time (default 30 seconds) or distance travelled (default 200 meters).
The mod currently includes 70+ effects. The list of effect will be updated and grow with each update

Effects can repeat the logic of cheat codes from the previous series of games (e.g. car spawn, car repair, get money), 
and change the feel of the gameplay by creating random enemies, NPC bodyguards, changing gravity, creating a forcefield around the player and much more.
