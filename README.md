# GTAIV-ChaosMod
A chaos mod for Grand Theft Auto IV based on [IV-SDK](https://github.com/Zolika1351/iv-sdk) by [Zolika1351](https://github.com/Zolika1351)
The mod is currently in closed beta testing. The estimated release time for open beta is fall-winter 2025.
Mod supports game versions 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0. (Tested on original GTAIV v1.0.8.0 and GTA VC NE v1.0.7.0)

# Description
This mod adds random effects (temporary or instant) to your game after a certain time (default 30 seconds) or distance travelled (default 200 meters).
Now mod has over 70 effects that change your gameplay. The list of effect will be updated and grow with each update

Effects can repeat the logic of cheat codes from the previous series of games (e.g. car spawn, car repair, get money), 
and change the feel of the gameplay by creating random enemies, NPC bodyguards, changing gravity, creating a forcefield around the player and much more.
